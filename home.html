Hi, I’m <span> Lexi! </span> This blog is about my life as a student in a science program. I want to share my daily experiences, the things I learn, and the small moments that make my journey special. School can be busy and sometimes hard, but it’s also full of lessons that go beyond books and classrooms.
<br><br>
In this space, you’ll see how I balance studies with everyday life. I’ll write about <span>friends, hobbies, and the little joys that keep me going. </span> My goal is to make this blog simple and easy to read, so anyone can follow along and feel connected to my story.</p>
